# DriverPass Reflection

## Project Overview:
The DriverPass project involved creating a more comprehensive system for users to learn about driving both fundamentally through classes and real-world practice. The main components of the project were 
to facilitate online learning through classes and practice tests, as well as being able to offer users an in-person road lesson to strengthen their practice with driving. Alongside this, the platform also
needed to facilitate integrated data management and reporting functionalities.

## The Client and System:
The client was DriverPass, owned by Liam, which envisioned a system that simplifies the scheduling and management of driving lessons. The system he wanted us to design was one that supports users in booking
sessions, managing instructor schedules, and handling payments efficiently. With an emphasis on user-friendliness, reliability, and scalability, we worked to accommodate future growth and technology integration.

## The Strengths of My Work:
One area I excelled was the detailed analysis and documentation of system design and its requirements. My ability to break down simple interview transcripts to design comprehensive and intuitive
system design was one of my greatest strengths throughout this process. Through the use of UML diagrams, I was able to convey information that would've otherwise been lost to a non-technically
savvy crowd, and as such I believe my final designs were robust, scalable, and aligned with client and user expectations.

## Areas for Improvement:
If I were to choose an aspect of my designs to improve upon, it would most likely be my lack of emphasis on data flow through my diagrams. In hindsight, I believe I could have been much more detailed on the
kind of data that flows between both use cases and user flow. This emphasis would have placed a greater emphasis on the kinds of data that pass through the application, from the user experience to the 
detailed reports on the administrative side.

## Interpreting User Needs and Implementation
One of the core aspects of this project was the emphasis on the user experience. As such, I placed great importance on following through with user expectations and placing their experience over many other
facets of the application. By engaging with the client and potential end users and studying the interview transcripts, I was able to understand their challenges and expectations. This is one of the main 
benefits of a more agile methodology, being able to collect feedback during many different stages of the development process. This user-centric approach informed my design decisions, ensuring the system was 
not only functional but also intuitive and accessible.

## My Approach to Designing Software
My approach to designing software emphasizes thorough planning, user involvement, and iterative development. I always have to start with a clear line of communication with the client or end users, and their 
problems and needs. Following this, I define functional and non-functional requirements to ensure I have everything down and my designs are an accurate representation of what is expected. I use techniques
like use case analysis, UML diagramming, and exploring design alternatives. Going forward, I most definitely plan on adopting more agile methodologies and user testing phases to ensure my work is up to 
the user's and client's standards.
